## Challenges and learnings
- I struggled with retriveing the stored scores from local storage and displaying them to highscores.
- Purposely didnt want much css styling as this task was about JS. Would use divs next time and hide/unhide them via css for nicer look. 
- Psudeo coding needs to be more consistent.
- Iterationg objects from an array to create an element then append as a child. This took many hours of research and trial and error!

 
## Features

- elements are created purely from JS
- able to save your initals against your score to local storage
- When you click on highscore it displays the highest 10 scores
